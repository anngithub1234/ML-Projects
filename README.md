# ML-Projects
## Gold Prediction
Developed and optimized predictive models for gold price forecasting using machine learning techniques such as Lasso regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost. Implemented data preprocessing, feature engineering, and hyperparameter tuning to improve model accuracy and interpretability. Used GridSearchCV for model optimization and ELI5 for explainability
## Cartooning a Picture
Developed a Cartoonizer app using Streamlit and OpenCV, which applies a cartoon effect to images by leveraging techniques such as bilateral filtering and adaptive thresholding. The app allows users to upload images and visualize the transformed cartoon version in real-time. Implemented user-friendly features including image upload and real-time processing, enhancing interaction and accessibility.
Bilateral filtering is a non-linear, edge-preserving, and noise-reducing image smoothing technique that is used to reduce noise while keeping edges sharp. It's commonly used in image processing tasks like denoising, image enhancement, and creating effects like cartoonization
Adaptive thresholding is an image processing technique used to convert a grayscale image into a binary image. Unlike simple thresholding, where a fixed threshold is applied to the entire image, adaptive thresholding calculates the threshold value for each pixel based on the local neighborhood of that pixel
